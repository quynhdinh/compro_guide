"Overcoming Homesickness: A Guide for International CS Students","As an international student pursuing Computer Science in the USA, homesickness can be a significant challenge. The key is creating a support system and maintaining connections. Join cultural student organizations and connect with others from your home country, but also branch out to make American friends. Set up regular video calls with family during times that work across time zones. Create a corner in your room with items from home - photos, favorite snacks, or cultural items. Cook familiar dishes when possible; many Asian groceries are available in university towns. Remember that feeling homesick is completely normal and shared by many international students. Try to maintain some traditions from home while embracing new American experiences. The CS community is particularly welcoming to international students, and group projects are great opportunities to bond with classmates.","student life,mental health,international student",1698000000
