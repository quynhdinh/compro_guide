      <h2>Welcome to Compro Guide</h2>
      <p>Compro Guide helps students who are joining or considering "Compro" (computer-related professional programs) in the USA. We collect course details, student reviews, and practical tips so you can pick the right classes, prepare for workload, and make the most of your program.</p>

      <h3>What you'll find on this site</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Courses</strong> — concise descriptions, common prerequisites, and student-submitted details so you can compare offerings across schools.</li>
        <li><strong>Reviews</strong> — real student feedback about course difficulty, workload, instructor quality, and practical usefulness.</li>
        <li><strong>How-to tips</strong> — study strategies, project ideas, and realistic expectations for commonly-taken classes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to use this site</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Start at the <strong>Courses</strong> page to browse classes. Click any course to view details and student reviews.</li>
        <li>Read multiple reviews to form a balanced view — look at workload, difficulty, and recent comments about the instructor or assignments.</li>
        <li>Use the <strong>Add a review</strong> form to share your experience after taking a class. Honest, specific feedback (examples of assignments or grading style) helps future students the most.</li>
        <li>If you're comparing sections or semesters, check the review timestamps — instructors and syllabi change over time.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Practical tips for Compro students</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Balance theory and practice:</strong> take one project-heavy course at a time if possible so you have time to build a portfolio piece.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for rubrics:</strong> if a course's grading is unclear, ask the instructor or TAs for the rubric early — it saves time later.</li>
        <li><strong>Form study groups:</strong> many assignments are easier and more educational when you collaborate and then implement independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Track time:</strong> log hours spent on homeworks for the first two assignments to estimate future workload accurately.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Contribute & keep it helpful</h3>
      <p>Share reviews that include course context (semester, instructor, project vs. exam-heavy), approximate hours/week, and a short comment about what helped you succeed. Respect privacy — don't post others' personal data.</p>

      <h3>Need more?</h3>
      <p>If you want extra features (filters, instructor pages, or exportable course lists), tell us — I can add them.</p>
